    "We still have a bit of analysis to wrap up, and then we need to create a table that helps Maji Ndogo's engineers track their progress. Let's start with the last bit of analysis. Its tempting to put all of the columns from all of the tables in one place/table, and then analyse the data, but on a database of this size in our hands, we're going to run into performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could spend a minute thinking about the questions we still have, and create queries to answer them, specifically. Doing this means that we will only use the data we need to answer our question. Let's summarise the data we need, and where to find it:\n",
    "- All of the information about the location of a water source is in the `location` table, specifically the `town` and `province` of that water source.\n",
    "- `water_source` has the `type_of_source` and the `number_of_people_served` by each source.\n",
    "- `visits` has queue information, and connects `source_id` to `location_id`. There were multiple visits to sites, so we need to be careful not to include duplicate data (visit_count > 1).\n",
    "- `well_pollution` has information about the quality of water from only wells, so we need to keep that in mind when we join this table.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: Previously, we couldn't link provinces and towns to the type of water sources, the number of people served by those sources, queue times, or pollution data, but we can now. So, what type of relationships can we look at?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things to think about:\n",
    "1. Are there any specific provinces, or towns where some sources are more abundant?\n",
    "2. We identified that `tap_in_home_broken` taps are easy wins. Are there any towns where this is a particular problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer question 1, we will need `province_name` and `town_name` from the `location` table. We also need to know `type_of_water_source` and `number_of_people_served` from the `water_source` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the `location` table uses `location_id` while `water_source` only has `source_id`. So we won't be able to join these tables directly. But the `visits` table maps `location_id` and `source_id`. So if we use `visits` as the table we query from, we can join `location` where the `location_id` matches, and `water_source` where the `source_id` matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to assemble data into a table first before we can analyse it. This will make our analysis less arduous than it needs to be!"

Maji Ndogo needs to send out their engineering teams to look at the infrastructure in Amanzi first.

To get around that, we have to group by province first, then by town, so that the duplicate towns are distinct because they are in different provinces."

If you close the database connection, it deletes the table, so you have to run it again each time you start working in MySQL.
