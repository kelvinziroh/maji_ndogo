# Restoring the lifeblood of Maji Ndogo
## Introduction
At the heart of this project is a **water crisis** faced by a fictitious **country** called **Maji Ndogo**. The project dives deep into the intricacies of using SQL to solve complex problems with data, siphoning interesting and thought-probing insights.

## Acknowledgments
This project was undertaken in partial fulfillment of the requirements on [ALX + Explore AI Academy's Data Science curriculum](https://www.explore.ai/learn/courses/data-science). 

## Project overview
This project is split into four parts, each progressively building from the last both in SQL syntax difficulty and depth of analysis. It also provides a good blueprint for how to approach and tackle problem solving using data.

## Part 1: Beginning our data-driven journey in Maji Ndogo
The first part of the project dives into Maji Ndogo's expansive database containing 60,000 records spread across various tables. As we navigate this trove of data, we'll use basic queries to familiarise ourselves with the content of each table. Along the way, we'll also refine some data using Data Manipulation Language (DML).

### Objectives
By the end of the project's first quadrant, one should be able to:
- Demonstrate the ability to **create** and **navigate through a new database**.
- Demonstrate the ability to **create** and **modify basic queries**.
- Demonstrate the ability to **use operators to create conditional filters**.
- Demonstrate an understanding of **operators** to **filter data with multiple criteria**.
- Demonstrate how to **use DML** and the **risks associated with changing a database**.

## Part 2: Clustering data to unveil Maji Ndogo's water crisis
In this second part of the project, we gear up for a deep analytical dive into Maji Ndogo's water scenario. Harness the power of a wide range of **functions**, including **intricate window functions**, to tease out insights from the data tables.

### Objectives
By the end of the project's second quadrant, one should be able to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of **SQL functions**.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how **SQL window functions** work and how to use them effectively.
- Demonstrate the ability to **use various functions** to **clean and analyse** data.
- Demonstrate an understanding of data **aggregation techniques**.

## Part 3: Weaving the data threads of Maji Ndogo's narrative
In this third part of the project, we will pull data from **many different tables** and apply some **statistical analyses** to examine the consequences of an audit report that cross-references a random sample of records.

### Objectives
By the end of the project's third quadrant, one should be able to:
- Demonstrate the ability to **retrieve data from multiple sources**.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the challenges associated with **joining multiple data sources together**.

## Part 4: Charting the course for Maji Ndogo's water future
In this final part of the project, we finalise our data analysis using the **full suite of SQL tools**. We will gain our final insights, use these to classify water sources, and prepare relevant data for the relevant stakeholders i.e. Maji Ndogo's engineering teams.

### Objectives
By the end of the project's final quadrant, one should be able to:
- Demonstrate the ability to **utilise filters, aggregations, functions, and joins together** in data analysis.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the **challenges faced in solving complex, real-world problems using SQL**.
- Demonstrate the ability to **use subqueries, CTEs** and **views**.
